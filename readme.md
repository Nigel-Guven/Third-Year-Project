# Innovative Cinema Listings

The project we plan on undertaking is creating an Android application which focuses on carpooling and the user specifically being students and commuters to work etc., 

Project Exposition Summary
Clever Carpooling is an Android application which aims to facilitate and improve navigation and peer-to-peer ridesharing, utilising Google Maps API. Users may sign up as either a driver or a passenger, or both. Drivers may 'post' a route which they plan on undertaking, and passengers may request a lift if they are going anywhere on that same route within a given distance. Clever Carpooling has many applications to our society as a whole, including helping to attack the climate problem, and making student/commuter life easier, to name but a few.

## Testing|Validation|User Review

Testing is being performed in two areas: Manual and Automated tests.

Manual tests are carried out by the developers and testing of UI functionality.

Automated tests are performed using Android Studio built-in testing suite and J-Unit, Java unit tests library. Also there is Integration testing of multiple classes/modules.
